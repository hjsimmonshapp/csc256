# Introduction
### About Me
Hi! My name is Haley and this is my 5th semester at Wake Tech :). I am currently pursuing my AAS in Computer Programming and Development. My hopes are to transfer to a 4 year university and complete a bachelors in Computer Science.
### My Hobbies
I love traveling! It is probably my most favorite thing to do. I plan on traveling to Europe within the next year which will be my first time. Aside from traveling, I enjoy reading, writing (being a published author is a dream!), playing video games, cooking, and spending time with my husband. My husband and I have 5 pets- 4 cats and 1 pug.
### My Hopes
I hope this semester goes well and I learn new things as well as refresh my knowledge. I do need to improve my C++ skills and sharpen general skills too.
